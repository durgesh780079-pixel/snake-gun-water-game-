# Game Rules

# Snake drinks Water → Snake wins
# Water disables Gun → Water wins
# Gun kills Snake → Gun wins
# Same choice by both → Draw



# Program Explanation


# The computer randomly selects Snake, Water, or Gun using the random module.

# The user inputs their choice (s, w, or g).

# A function compares both choices and returns:

# True → User wins
# False → User loses
# None → Draw
# The result is displayed using f-strings for better readability.
